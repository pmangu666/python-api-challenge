# python-api-challenge

This is The Python API Challenge! I have a weather report for 574 random cities and I compare Northern vs Southern Hemispheres on max temp, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. It was a lot of fun using an API key for this. I also really loved adding the hotel names to the hover feature over the map. Very nice.
The linear regression lines were interesting to compare. Thank you for looking at this :)
Challenges I faced were with the local repository. There is a random test folder that is very important that I included. It is detrimental to my local and remote repositories. Thank you so much.
