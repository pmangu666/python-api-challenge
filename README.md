# python-api-challenge

This is The Python API Challenge! I have a weather report for 596 random cities and I compare Northern vs Southern Hemispheres on max temp, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. It was a lot of fun using an API key for this. 
The linear regression lines were interesting to compare. Thank you for looking at this :)
